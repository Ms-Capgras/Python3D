# Python3D

Python3D is a module for Python for rendering 3D models to a window.

NOTE: This project is far from finished and currently does not provide
any of the 3D modelling functionality that it will provide in its first
full release.

## What does Python3D do and why?

It allows the creation of 3D spaces containing 3D objects which can be
viewed from the perspective of a camera that can be positioned and rotated
within the space.

This massively simplifies the rendering of 3D models in Python as well as
providing a useful basis for 3D video games and animations.

## Where can I get help with Python3D?

When version 1.0.0 releases, documentation for every class and method
included in Python3D will be available right here on GitHub!

## Requirements/Dependencies

This project in its current version requires that you have PIL and numpy
installed.

## Contributions

Python3D is currently a solo project made only by me!
